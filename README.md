# ifigures
Interactive, free and sharable browser-based platform for scientific presentation.

An interactive figure which is an .html file that is readable by modern browsers which includes a visual presentation of data/calculations and provides access to the underlying data/calculations in electronic form. In addition, ifigures typically allow simple manipulation of the presentation such as zooming. ifigures are a useful way to convey scientific information. ifigures may also provide a basic tool for calculations, simulations and data analysis suitable for small projects and for science education. 

ifigure file names should have an .ifig.html extension.

 

The ifigures in this website were created using the ifigures tool (formerly named ballab) that we are actively developing. Each of these ifigure html files contains the ifigures javascript tools inside the file and can be used to create new ifigures. ifigures is an open source code under the MIT license. It is in an early development phase and (likely) contains bugs. Use it at your own risk.
